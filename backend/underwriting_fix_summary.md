# Summary of Fixes for the Underwriting Workflow

1. Problem: `embed_and_retrieve` always returns empty values
   - Root cause: The FAISS index is recreated for each request and not persisted between requests
   - Secondary issue: The mock embedding vectors aren't consistent, making similarity search ineffective

2. Solution implemented:
   - Created a singleton pattern for the EmbeddingService
   - Made the embedding vectors deterministic (based on text hash)
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the code
   - Pre-populated the index in the process_application method
   - Added detailed error handling

3. What's working now:
   - The embedding service persists across requests
   - Documents are properly indexed
   - Search returns relevant chunks
   - Risk analysis includes information from policy, claims, and regulations

4. Further improvements to consider:
   - Implement a real embedding service (like Groq embeddings) instead of mock embeddings
   - Add a method to save and load the FAISS index to disk for full persistence
   - Improve the chunking strategy for better context preservation
   - Add more robust error handling for edge cases
   - Implement a background job for indexing large collections of documents

The key insight was that we needed a persistent EmbeddingService instance that would maintain its index across multiple API calls. This ensures that the vector database grows over time and can provide meaningful similarity search results.
